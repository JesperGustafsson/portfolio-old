            <p>I have just finished the actual chess game part of my chess website. It (should) work bug-free. In the future I would like to make an authentication system as well as incorporate a chat, but for now I think I want to
                focus on making a more detailed portfolio site, as this version was just something I quickly threw together to show possible employers my projects. </p>
            <p>Other future plans include making a website for a mock-restaurant and projects using Java/C#/Python.</p>
